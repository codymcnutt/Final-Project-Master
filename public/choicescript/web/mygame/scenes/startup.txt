Welcome to Lives of Wizards!
*page_break
Let us begin Master Wizard. 
In this book we will explore the lives of Wizards and their secrets. More to the point we will explore your journey as you became a great and powerful wizard. Now doesn’t that sound fun? Let’s begin. 


*page_break

In your study as you finish a spell you have been working on you realize that you forgot an important component of the spell. How do you finish casting the spell? 

*fake_choice
  #I add some lizards breath to the potion.
    Lizards breath is an excellent choice my liege as it will give unpleasant dreams to all who taste it. How sneaky of you. Surely you are a master of potions and poisons. 
    *set potion true
    *set empty_inventory false
  #I recite the secret incantations
    Did your mother pass down an ancient book of incantations and spells, guard it well. You have a way with words and easily remember written spells.
    *set book true
    *set empty_inventory false   
  #Using a mysterious talisman I activate the spell
    Such powerful artifacts are rare, but to you a master of amulets and talismans this little gem is but a trifle.
    *set amulet true
    *set empty_inventory false
  #My summoned sprites and spirits help me finish the spell
    A conjurer of cheap tricks? Perhaps not in your case, you don’t trifle with minor spirits, but are a master of horrors and daemons most wizards never know exist. 
    *set summonstone true
    *set empty_inventory false
  #One of my apprentices finishes the spell for me
    Oh, what a good idea, having others do your work for you. You must be well practiced in the subtleties of mental manipulation, playing tricks on the mind is a small matter for you. Illusions are  your     
    game.  
        
*comment endif

Excellent, now that the spell has been prepared and is ready to use. Um, what exactly does it do?
*fake_choice 
  *if (potion=true)
    #It’s a fine poison for my enemies
     Good thinking! Clever planning like this will be useful, when you have dangerous enemies. 
     *line_break
     You gained a poison potion
     *image poison.png
  *if (book=true)
    #It’s a scroll filled with power to make someone sleep
     Oh how sneaky of you, sweet dreams will fill some enemies dreams while you make moves against them.
     *line_break
     *image book.png
     You gained a spellbook 
  *if (amulet=true)
    #An amulet to ward off minor spells
     That’s thinking ahead, you never know when some wizard is going to try to hurt you with a minor spell. Those are the most dangerous kind.
     *line_break
     You gained an amulet
     *image Amulet.png
  *if (summonstone=true)
    #A shiny orb to communicate with spirits on the astral plane
     Be careful, those spirits scare me, but it will come in handy being able to communicate with them. 
     *line_break
     You gained a summoning stone
     *image stone.png
  #I don’t know ask my apprentice what it does?
    While it’s great to have help, being unaware of your apprentice is dangerous.

This would be a good time to discuss your background and strengths. 

All Wizards can be described in terms of a handful of characteristics, each in opposed pairs: Weakness and Strength, Stupidity and Intelligence, Ugliness and Beauty, Prestige and Unimportance.  

Are you more notable for your Weakness or your Ugliness? 
*fake_choice 
  #Weakness: low physical damage
   Well ${name} no one ever said you were tough or strong, but you don't suffer from being horribly ugly. 
   *line_break
   Weakness increases 15%
   *set weakness %+30
  #Ugliness: Damaging to the eyes 
   Mirrors shudder when you walk in a room, a lot of people have tried to kill you for being so ugly. 
   *line_break
   Ugnilness increases 15%
   *set ugliness %+30
*comment endif 

Do you have more stupidity or unimportance? 
*fake_choice
 #Stupidity: Learning hard is  
  Ok it might be hard for you to be a wizard ${name} because you can't read
  *line_break
  Stupidity increases 15%
  *set stupidity %+30
 #Unimportance: Nobody cares about you
  You are completely unoticed in the world. If you die nobody even knows it, but at least nobody ever called ${name} stupid.
  *set prestige %-30
  *line_break
  Unimportance increases 15%
*comment endif

As a child did you have an appetite for learning or did you spent most of your time outside fighting and rough housing with the other children. 
*fake_choice
 #I was always eager to learn
   You always had a book with you and spent your younger days learning 
   *set stupidity %-20
   Stupidity decreases 10%
 #Usually I was outside fighting and playing with the other kids. 
   You preffered play fighting to learning, which made you stronger 
   *set weakness %-20
   *line_break 
   Weakness decreases 10%
*comment endif

Your childhood was at times difficult. And you encountered many new and amazing experiences.  

Except for a night you will never forget. You were on your way home and something truly traumatic and frightening happened to you.
If you don’t mind me asking what was it that happened that night?
*fake_choice
  
  *if (ugliness < 51)
    #I was walking home and four thugs stepped out of a warehouse and beat me to within an inch of my life. As I lay there sure I would die a city guard came around the corner, running towards my limp body he chased off the thugs and carried me to safety. 
      Ever since that night you have had trouble with your right leg. The scars mark your body. And the momories mark your mind. You struggle interacting with people because of that night.

  #After a night of exploring some abandoned warehouses by the docks I stumbled into a room that appeared to be a torture chamber, it was filled with dead bodies and decapitated heads. 
    The screams of tortured bodies still haunt your dreams. You can't stand the sight of blood. 
    *line_break
    You gained fear: Bloodthirsty -20% to tests with blood.

  #As I headed down an alley I noticed sitting atop one of the buildings a giant brown spider. It was watching me. Sitting silently, I froze as the spider started running towards me. I escaped but just barely.   
    You are now afraid of most bugs, but if you see a spider terror strikes you and paralyzes you.

And where you lived was your family wealthy or poor? 
*fake_choice
  #I always had the best clothes, books, food, etc. My father was a merchant and we had a great deal of money. 
   Your family had wealth and power. Growing up you lived like royalty and had the finest of everything. 
   *set familyWealth 2
   *set prestige %+20
  #My parents owned a candle shop. We lived ok, but we were not rich. I never went hungry. Sometimes I got new clothes if my siblings grew out of them. 
   Your family isn't rich but you aren't poor either. You lived like most peasants. 
   *set familyWealth 1
   
  #There was a time my parents were wealthy but we lost everything when my dad died in an accident at the mines. My mother tried the best she could but we grew up hungry and cold. 
   You know about the haves and the have naughts. Growing up you were usually poor. 
  #My parents both died when I was a child. I grew up on the streets and learned to take care of myself. 
   Growing up poor on the streets made you tougher than most people. But you also went unoticed most of the time.

Knock, Knock, Knock one of your apprentices opens the door and steps into the room.

   Your apprentice seems pretty shaken up. After a moment you get him to calm down and he tells you that a pack of hellhounds has been seen heading for your home.

    Right you are. When the Hellhounds threw themselves at your defenses they were obliterated. 
   *if (prestige > 54)
    Although it was close, your defenses held against the asault of the Hellhound pack. A lot of guards died and your defenses have been significantly weakened.
