Welcome to Lives of Wizards!
*page_break
Let us begin Master Wizard. 
In this book we will explore the lives of Wizards and their secrets. More to the point we will explore your journey as you became a great and powerful wizard. Now doesn’t that sound fun? Let’s begin. 


*page_break

In your study as you finish a spell you have been working on you realize that you forgot an important component of the spell. How do you finish casting the spell?

  #I add some lizards breath to the potion.
    Lizards breath is an excellent choice my liege as it will give unpleasant dreams to all who taste it. How sneaky of you. Surely you are a master of potions and poisons. 
    *set potion true
    *set empty_inventory false
  #I recite the secret incantations
    Did your mother pass down an ancient book of incantations and spells, guard it well. You have a way with words and easily remember written spells.
    *set book true
    *set empty_inventory false   
  #Using a mysterious talisman I activate the spell
    Such powerful artifacts are rare, but to you a master of amulets and talismans this little gem is but a trifle.
    *set amulet true
    *set empty_inventory false
  #My summoned sprites and spirits help me finish the spell
    A conjurer of cheap tricks? Perhaps not in your case, you don’t trifle with minor spirits, but are a master of horrors and daemons most wizards never know exist. 
    *set summonstone true
    *set empty_inventory false
  #One of my apprentices finishes the spell for me
    Oh, what a good idea, having others do your work for you. You must be well practiced in the subtleties of mental manipulation, playing tricks on the mind is a small matter for you. Illusions are  your     
    game.

This would be a good time to discuss your background and strengths. 

All Wizards can be described in terms of a handful of characteristics, each in opposed pairs: Weakness and Strength, Stupidity and Intelligence, Ugliness and Beauty, Prestige and Unimportance.  

Are you more notable for your Weakness or your Ugliness?
